        <h1>MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h1>

<p>MY name is Andeline Yaa Agyeiwaa Addai. I was born on Thursday November 04, 2004. My parents are Mr. Samuel Addai and Mrs. Dora
Addai. I have three siblings- two older ones and a younger brother. There are a few things I like and a few things I don't like. 
I like going out with my friends to visit tourist sites. I love serene places. I also like being in my room , either playing games or watching movies. 
One of the few things I don't like is being bothered when I'm busy or sleeping. I really don't joke with my sleep. I aspire to become a biomedical engineer 
in the near future hence my choice of pursuing Bsc. Biomedical Engineering in the university.   
</p>
      
<p>My choice of studying Biomedical Engineering was not forced. I chose this choice because, it has always been
        my passion to help people and also help improve the lives of individuals by impacting the accessibility of medical technology through
        development of new projects.
